# SM-NC-News

# Project Title

This is the back-end API for my Northcoders News project. 

Link to the Front-End : https://github.com/sobmortin/SM-NC-NEWS-FE

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project requires PostgreSQL

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

\$ npm i

$ npm run seed-db

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

run npm t

For testing I used supertest and chai to check the connection to the database was correct, CRUD requests functioned as expected, and error handling was robust and gave clear instructions to the user.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

- [Postgres](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used

## Authors

Sebastian Martin
